## The Brief

At School of Code, we were tasked with creating & sharing an educational piece of content, relating to a topic we'd been learning recently. I decided to pick up an advanced feature of TypeScript and present elements of it that are hopefully easy to digest. 


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h3><u>MVP</u></h3>

- Two short video samples (no audio) of two bespoke TypeScript exercises (created personally).
- Two lists to support the videos to walk the user through the steps presented from the video content.
- Basic Header, Footer, Intro, Subintro and Summary sections.
- Passable CSS.
- Tech Stack: Next.js, deployed with Vercel.

<h3><u>MS2</u></h3>

- Setup section, where the list is viewable with an accordion-styled component on click.
- Ensure hover interaction colour change on the Setup section.


<h3><u>Update 1 - 2025-02-24</u></h3>

- Mobile Compatibility: Multiple custom media queries added, including video and text size re-adjustments, and word wrapping to keep content viewable.

- Added pointer cursor on hover for Setup to make it more obvious it's interactable.

<h4>Mobile view</h4>

## Future Milestones

<h3><u>MS3</u></h3>

- Add content for Accessors, Parameters and Properties.
- Add background music, and/or unobtrusive SFX.
- Make a custom playback video player so redundant controls are not visible (ie sound).

## Future Patches
- Bespoke media query for Setup list so items or bullet points no longer clip on mobile.
- Improved Styling.
- Implement an image expander to showcase decorator code where it's not easily seen inside the video content.
